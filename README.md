# Node JS Fundamentals Concepts

## Google Chrome JavaScript Runtime Environment

What do we mean by a Runtime Environemt, is all components needed to run or execute
JavaScript program. This time around we are taking about Runtime Environment into a 
Google Chrome Browser, also know as V8 Engine.  

V8 as designed by Google in 2008, enabling JavaScript programs to runs outside a browser
so now we are able to execute JS programs by using a JRE knows as Node JS, 
which we can use to build backend services like API, based on terminal or CLI programs and more.
